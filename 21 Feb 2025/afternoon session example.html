<h2 style="color:blue;">HTML DEFINITION</h2>
<p><del>XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").
XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.</del>

<p><mark>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.</mark> For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
